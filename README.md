## About Me

Design Engineer with experience in architectural research, design & development
of RTL IPs. I have worked on micro-architecture design for Processor Core based
on the open RISC-V ISA. Gained strong analytical, management, debugging and
problem solving skills along with strong command over HDL & scripting languages.
Initiative driven, team player; I thrive well in fast-paced work environment.

### Technical Intresets

I am enthusiastic about working on diverse design aspects of architectures/IPs, including but not limited to IOMMUâ€™s,
Virtualization for Accelerators & DMA Engines, SIMD/Vector Architectures, UCIe & D2D controllers, Hardware assisted garbage
collection for JIT languages, Compression Engines in Memory Hierarchy etc. I have explored low power architectures for cores
& caches; have a high level understanding of multivoltage UPF flow, DVFS and am eager to extend my focus in this domain.

I also thoroughly enjoyed developing from scratch a build infrastructure centered around makefiles; which contains
generic tool scripts, directory structure & file naming format. It supports process nodes such as TSMC 16nm, 5nm and
more recently 3nm. The tools included were synopsys vcs, design compiler, formality, spyglass, primetime, primepower;
functional safety tools such as vc-fsm, vc-zoix and the open source style lint tool verible. This streamlined the entire
frontend toolflow, reducing turn-around time for any new or existing IPs.

**I enjoy working on various aspects of IP development; codebase, scripts & documentation management, defining and
developing toolflows/workflows; working around open source tools.**
